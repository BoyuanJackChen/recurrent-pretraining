Create a word game the answer of which is “{word}” by giving hints on the characters and/or syllables that comprise the word. Make sure to give at least 5 hints (there can be redundancy) so that we can rank the participants by how may hints they viewed before arriving at the correct answer. Only generate the hints. Do not include any other instructions or comments. 

In your generated answer, you must follow this format:
Hint 1: ...
Hint 2: ...
...
Hint n: ...
