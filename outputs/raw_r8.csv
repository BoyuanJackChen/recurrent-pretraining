The study, published in the prestigious journal Nature, suggests that the Core-Eruption could occur within the next few decades, potentially leading to the end of the world as we know it.\n\nThe scientists who conducted the study believe that the Core-Eruption could be triggered by a combination of factors, including the Earth's natural processes and human activities.
